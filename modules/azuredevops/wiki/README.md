- This module creates Azure Devops Project Wiki of type **projectWiki**
- Wikis are not implemented in Terraform Azure Devops Provider hence I used [terracurl](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/devops-rob/terracurl/latest/docs/resources/request) provider to call AzDO API endpoint.
- [API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wiki/wikis/create?view=azure-devops-rest-7.0)
- This API does not support CRUD operations for **projectWiki** type. Because of this destroy operation is "fake", so in order for this module to be indempotent we need to read existing Wiki ID in case they are already created.
- Probably this is why Microsoft has not implemented a "wiki" resource in azuredevops Terraform provider.
